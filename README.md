# Myke's Mystical Emporium

This project was a one-day group project where we used an external api, in this case openai/chat-gpt, to make a 'fortune teller' site. There is also a 'find out who your soulmate is' feature.

Complete with tacky, dodgy-looking stylings and fake ads, it was a fun introduction to api's.

It makes use of the SASS framework for styling.
